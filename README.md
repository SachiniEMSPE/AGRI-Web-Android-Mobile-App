# AGRI-Web Android Mobile App

I designed and implemented this mobile app during my Ph.D. as part of my Research Assistant work, although it is not related to my dissertation work. In addition to my supervisor, I collaborated with a researcher from Ghana to learn about the domain and specific subject matters.
